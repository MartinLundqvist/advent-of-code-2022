# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2022 Puzzle submissions

Given a full time job and time zone differences I'll struggle earn any points for fast submissions. I love the puzzles, though. Instead my goal is to write clear and readable code, to get it right the first time, and enjoy myself!
